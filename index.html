            Visual studio is a simple coding software used to create websites games etc.
            You can use the normal vidual studio IDE or many other different ones.you can download
            IDE's from extensions eg. search tabnine and install it on visua studio and start coding.
            To do other languages i think you need to download to use them (i thing   i have no idea)

            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.

Windows Console instances are typically used for apps that do not need to display images but might use color. Examples include cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, Far Manager, and Midnight Commander.

In 2019, the Windows Console infrastructure was open-sourced under the MIT License, alongside Windows Terminal.[1]
